401,"Pointing to the buildings, especially because you could not move or see anything past a few buildings. ","I didn't have trouble remembering the names.

The locations were harder, but I memorized the buildings in order so that helped a little. "
419,Putting the paths together to create the campus.,"The positions of the buildings were hardest. To remember the names, I used similar words and word association to remember.

"
748,Pointing to where the buildings are in relation to the others.,The positions were harder than the names.

3355,Remembering which directions the buildings were in.,The names were pretty easy to remember because I can remember terms pretty easily and quickly. Positions were harder but I tried to remember which buildings were next/near each other.

Once I knew where one building was relative to the current point, I attempted to remember one building as an anchor and determine where the other buildings were based off of it.","Yes I had trouble remembering the names of the buildings.
